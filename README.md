# TMNext Platform Titlepack

The titlepack implementation in TM2020, managed by OpenPlanet script.

## What does even titlepack mean?

It means **a mode / a minigame / DLC (free one)** for TM2020, that adds custom gamemode, custom campaign, custom menus, custom UIs, custom musics, ... 
And most importantly completely new feel! You won't be able to identify you are playing TM2020, you might think that you are in ManiaPlanet :D
